Read the following information carefully and observe it strictly. WARNING ● Before driving, make sure all occupants are properly buckled up to prevent serious injury or death in emergency braking or in a collision. ● The seat belts are designed for adults and are not intended for children. Make sure to choose an appropriate child restraint system according to your child's age and size (see P21 in this chapter). ● If a seat belt is damaged or malfunctions, immediately contact a BYD authorized dealer or service provider for confirmation and handling. Until then, do not use the corresponding seat. ● BYD has highly emphasized that all occupants should always fasten their seat belts while in the vehicle to prevent serious injury or death. ● It is recommended that children be seated in rear seats and always use seat belts and suitable child restraints. In case of emergency braking or a collision, unprotected children may be seriously injured and their lives may be endangered. Likewise, do not allow a child to be carried on someone's lap. This will render the children not adequately protected.

Release the button to lock the adjuster. 5. Pull the belt firmly to check that the adjuster is locked. WARNING ● The shoulder belt should cross the center of the shoulder. The seat belt should be far from the neck and not be liable to slip from the shoulder, otherwise, it cannot function well in the event of emergency braking or accident and may even cause severe injury. ● The lap belt should be positioned as low as possible around the hips to avoid serious injury due to the intense lap belt forces against the abdomen in an accident. ● The seat belt should be fitted tight to the body for better protection. 6. Unlock the seat belt. ● Press the red unlock button on the buckle. The latch plate pops out, and the seat belt automatically retracts. If the seat belt does not retract smoothly and automatically, pull it out and check whether it is twisted. WARNING ● One seat belt is for one occupant only.

Until then, do not use the corresponding seat. ● Do not remove, disassemble or modify the seat belts. ● After an accident, have the seat belts checked at a BYD authorized dealer or service provider. If the pretensioner function is activated, the seat belt must be replaced. ● In the event of a serious accident, even if there is no apparent damage, the seat belt should be replaced along with the seat assembly. The airbag system should also be thoroughly inspected. ● Pregnant women need to fasten the seat belts properly and position the lapbelt as low as possible around the hips to avoid serious injury from the intense lap belt forces against the abdomen in an accident. ● The method of wearing a rear seat belt is the same as that for a front seat belt. For normal functioning of the rear seat belt, ensure that its latch is inserted into the corresponding buckle during use. The driver should WARNING remind passengers to wear seat belts properly. ● Do not insert foreign objects such as coins and clips into the buckle as they prevent proper connection between the latch and buckle.

Do not use the corresponding seat until the functions return to normal. ● When driving, make sure all occupants have their seat belts properly fastened to prevent serious injury or death in emergency braking or in a collision. Airbags Airbag Overview ● The airbag system is a part of supplemental restraint system and also a supplement to seat belts. When the vehicle is involved in a serious collision and the airbag system meets its deployment conditions, relevant airbags will rapidly deploy, and along with seat belts, provide additional protection for heads and chests of the occupants, reducing likelihood of personal injuries or even death. ● Airbags are divided into front and side types according to the type of collision. The front airbags include a driver airbag and a front passenger airbag, while the side airbags include seat side airbags and side curtain airbags. ● As an integral part of the vehicle's passive safety protection system, the airbag system does not replace seat belts, and must be used in combination with seat belts to maximize protection. WARNING ● Occupants must sit in a proper position to maximize the protection provided by seat belts and the airbag system. ● Do not disassemble or assemble airbag components. ● If the seatbacks get wet from rain or splashes, the side airbag system may not work properly. ● Do not use seat covers, as they restrict airbag deployment on the corresponding side in an accident. ● Do not place anything between the side airbag and the occupant. ● Do not apply excessive force to th...",

It will not cause injury, but it may cause tinnitus or temporary deafness. ● A cloud of dust from the airbag surface may come off when the airbag deploys. Although such powder is non-toxic, individuals with respiratory problem might experience some temporary discomfort. WARNING ● No accessories, such as telephone holders, cups, ashtrays, may be installed on airbag covers or within their action range. Otherwise, airbag deployment will increase the risk of injury in an accident. Seat Side Airbags Front/Rear seat side airbags ● The vehicle is equipped with front/ rear seat side airbags (mounted on the outside of seat back, marked with \"AIRBAG\" at both sides). When a moderate to severe side impact is detected during vehicle travel and the triggering conditions are met, the airbag deploys to protect the chest of the occupant on the side of collision. ● Generally, only the airbag on the impacted side deploys in the event of a side impact. ● If the impact occurs on the passenger's side, the airbag on the passenger's side deploys even if there is no passenger in the seat. ● For optimal front/rear side airbag protection, occupants must have their seat belts fastened and sit upright against the seatback.

The airbag system may be triggered in special collisions. ● The airbag system does not always work in any accident, and generally it will not be triggered in the event of a minor frontal collision, rear collision or rollover. In this case, the driver and passengers are protected by their properly fastened seat belts. ● Determinants of airbag system triggering: Decision is made by comparing the deceleration curve, generated in the collision and obtained by the electronic control unit (ECU) and the set value. If signals, such as the deceleration curve generated and measured in the collision, are lower than the respective reference values preset in the ECU, the airbag system will not be triggered even if the vehicle may have been seriously deformed in the accident. ● The ECU of the BYD airbag system has been set up with considerations of common misuse and road conditions. However, due to the increasing changes in causes and forms of vehicle collisions, for your safety, please strictly follow this user manual, use the vehicle correctly, and avoid its misuse. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the airbags will achieve their expected effect.

The vehicle is ready to drive even if the charging connector is left plugged but not fully locked, which may damage the charging equipment and the vehicle. ● Too high or too low battery temperatures compromise vehicle charging performance. ● The temperature control system can improve the battery's charging capacity at low temperatures. Due to output capacity limitations of charging piles, the charging time is extended, the heating time becomes longer and the power consumption of heating is increased. This is a normal phenomenon. ● For faster low-temperature DC charging, charging from low SOC is recommended because, due to the low battery temperature, the charging current is small for vehicles with high SOC in low-temperature environments. ● To improve your experience, it is recommended to charge the vehicle immediately after using it, as the battery is relatively hot and has better charging performance. ● In low-temperature regions, it...",

Lane Departure Assist (LDA) Lane Departure Warning (LDW) Lane departure warning (LDW) detects the lane lines ahead through a multi- purpose camera. When the vehicle speed is 60 - 150 km/h and the driver unintentionally drifts out of the lane, the LDW system warns the driver by steering wheel vibration, a sound, and an instrument cluster prompt. Lane Departure Prevention (LDP) ● Lane departure prevention (LDP) identifies lane lines ahead through a multi-purpose camera. If the driver unknowingly departs from the lane at a vehicle speed between 60 km/h and 150 km/h such that the vehicle is about to roll over lane lines, the system, when activated, slightly turns the steering wheel by providing reverse torque through the electronic power steering (EPS) system to prevent lane departure. ● If LDP is activated for over 5 seconds, it gives visual and audible alarms at the fifth second and continues until this activation ends. Alarm mode: audible alarm, visual alarm. If the system is activated twice or more within a continued 180-second cycle, the system alarms immediately. For the third activation (and any further ones), alarms are extended by at least 12 seconds.

Fogging of lights ● Combination lights, tail lights, and turn signals on the side mirrors may become foggy after heavy rain or cleaning. This is similar to condensation on the side window during rain. It does not mean any problem with your vehicle. ● The lights are a relatively enclosed and narrow space. The temperature is very high when they light up (the mask and reflector could be burned and deformed easily), so they need heat dissipation. There are heat dissipation holes on the lamp housing for convection. The greater the temperature difference is, the more active the convection is. During the convection, the moisture in the air inevitably enters a lamp. Factors such as exposure to sunlight, convection, and bulb heating can cause the moisture in the air to condense into fog or water beads easily on the lamp surface at low temperatures. This is called fogging of lights.
