Read the following information carefully and observe it strictly. WARNING â Before driving, make sure all occupants are properly buckled up to prevent serious injury or death in emergency braking or in a collision. â The seat belts are designed for adults and are not intended for children. Make sure to choose an appropriate child restraint system according to your child's age and size (see P21 in this chapter). â If a seat belt is damaged or malfunctions, immediately contact a BYD authorized dealer or service provider for confirmation and handling. Until then, do not use the corresponding seat. â BYD has highly emphasized that all occupants should always fasten their seat belts while in the vehicle to prevent serious injury or death. â It is recommended that children be seated in rear seats and always use seat belts and suitable child restraints. In case of emergency braking or a collision, unprotected children may be seriously injured and their lives may be endangered. Likewise, do not allow a child to be carried on someone's lap. This will render the children not adequately protected. Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) â When the driver turns sharply or brakes suddenly, when there is a collision, or when the occupant leans forward too quickly, the seat belt automatically locks to effectively restrain and protect the occupant. â When the vehicle travels smoothly, seat belts are pulled out and retracted as the...",

Do not use the corresponding seat until the functions return to normal. â When driving, make sure all occupants have their seat belts properly fastened to prevent serious injury or death in emergency braking or in a collision. Airbags Airbag Overview â The airbag system is a part of supplemental restraint system and also a supplement to seat belts. When the vehicle is involved in a serious collision and the airbag system meets its deployment conditions, relevant airbags will rapidly deploy, and along with seat belts, provide additional protection for heads and chests of the occupants, reducing likelihood of personal injuries or even death. â Airbags are divided into front and side types according to the type of collision. The front airbags include a driver airbag and a front passenger airbag, while the side airbags include seat side airbags and side curtain airbags. â As an integral part of the vehicle's passive safety protection system, the airbag system does not replace seat belts, and must be used in combination with seat belts to maximize protection. WARNING â Occupants must sit in a proper position to maximize the protection provided by seat belts and the airbag system. â Do not disassemble or assemble airbag components. â If the seatbacks get wet from rain or splashes, the side airbag system may not work properly. â Do not use seat covers, as they restrict airbag deployment on the corresponding side in an accident. â Do not place anything between the side airbag and the occupant. â Do not apply excessive force to th...",

It will not cause injury, but it may cause tinnitus or temporary deafness. â A cloud of dust from the airbag surface may come off when the airbag deploys. Although such powder is non-toxic, individuals with respiratory problem might experience some temporary discomfort. WARNING â No accessories, such as telephone holders, cups, ashtrays, may be installed on airbag covers or within their action range.

    "content": "Airbag Triggering Conditions and Precautions Airbag Triggering Conditions â Airbag triggering conditions: In the event of a vehicle collision, whether an airbag will be triggered is decided by factors such as the amount of collision energy, accident type, collision angle, obstacle type, and vehicle speed. The airbag system may be triggered in special collisions. â The airbag system does not always work in any accident, and generally it will not be triggered in the event of a minor frontal collision, rear collision or rollover. In this case, the driver and passengers are protected by their properly fastened seat belts. â Determinants of airbag system triggering: Decision is made by comparing the deceleration curve, generated in the collision and obtained by the electronic control unit (ECU) and the set value. If signals, such as the deceleration curve generated and measured in the collision, are lower than the respective reference values preset in the ECU, the airbag system will not be triggered even if the vehicle may have been seriously deformed in the accident. â The ECU of the BYD airbag system has been set up with considerations of common misuse and road conditions. However, due to the increasing changes in causes and forms of vehicle collisions, for your safety, please strictly follow this user manual, use the vehicle correctly, and avoid its misuse.

Regenerative braking setting: â The vehicle is equipped with regenerative braking and you can set the regenerative braking intensity in the infotainment touchscreen â   â Energy â Energy Manager. In high energy recovery mode, more energy is recovered during vehicle braking and coasting.You can set to suit to your driving habits. 2. Maintaining constant speed: â Constant speeds save energy. Sudden acceleration, sharp turns and emergency braking increase consumption. â Speeds should be kept constant according to traffic conditions. Additional energy is consumed each time the accelerator is pushed. â Acceleration should be gradual. Avoid sudden startup, acceleration, or deceleration. â Prevent emergency braking, and subsequent brake wear, by keeping an appropriate distance from vehicles ahead, and paying attention to traffic lights. â Congested roads increase energy consumption. â Keep moderate speeds in motorways. The higher the speed, the higher the consumption. Maintaining vehicle speed within the economical speed range can save power. 3. Reducing load: â Energy consumption is higher when air conditioning is used. Turn off the A/C to reduce power consumption. When outside temperatures are moderate, use fresh air mode. â Do not overload the vehicle unnecessarily. Excessive weights add the load of vehicle, increasing energy consumption. 4.

Driving Safety Systems For better driving safety, the following driving safety systems works automatically based on driving conditions. However, these systems only provide assistance, and excessive reliance on them is not recommended. Intelligent Power Braking System â The intelligent power braking system is an advanced decoupled electro-hydraulic braking system, incorporating vacuum booster, electronic vacuum pump, and ABS/ESC functionality. â The system assists vehicle braking according to the driver's demands. It offers advanced control functions such as ABS, electronic brake force distribution (EBD), traction control system (TCS), vehicle dynamic control (VDC), comfort parking (CST), hill- start hold control (HHC), hydraulic brake assist (HBA), and controlled deceleration for parking brake (CDP) to improve vehicle stability and comfort, and the recovery efficiency of brake energy.

CDP stops working when the \"P\" button released. Intelligent power braking system has the following new functions compared with the original ESC system: â Brake assist mode â The brake assist mode is used to adjust the brake pedal feel. The relation curve between the brake pedal depth and the vehicle deceleration varies across different modes for the driver to choose their preferred pedal feel. â To set the brake assist mode, go to the infotainment touchscreen â  â Vehicle â Intelligent Chassisâ Brake assist mode. â Comfort parking (CST) â Comfort parking: When the vehicle decelerates to stop in a non- emergency situation, intelligent power braking system reduces the stop-instant suspension pitch and impact by controlling the brake pressure of the four brakes, and provides a smooth stop feeling. â Enable or disable this function in infotainment touchscreen â   â Vehicle â Intelligent Chassis â Comfort stop. â After the function is triggered, the braking distance may increase by 2-5 cm.

    "content": "â ABS helps maintain the steering control by preventing the wheels from locking or skidding when brake is engaged suddenly or on slippery roads. â When the front tires skid, there is no steering control, which means that the vehicle still moves forward even though the steering wheel is turned. ABS helps prevent locking and maintain steering control since pulsating prompt brake is much faster than human reaction. â Never pulsate the brake pedal; otherwise, ABS may malfunction. While steering away from danger, a firm and steady pressure should always be maintained on the brake pedal for the ABS to work. â When the ABS is working, the brake pedal will vibrate, which may produce noise. This is normal because ABS is pulsating the brake quickly. Electronic brake force distribution (EBD) â The EBD is an auxiliary function of ABS. Before ABS acts, if the skid rate of rear wheel is high, ABS adjusts the brake pressure of rear wheel for a smoother and more ideal brake force distribution. WARNING â ABS cannot work effectively under the following conditions: â Tires with inadequate grip are used (for example, excessively worn tires used on snow- covered roads). â The vehicle skids when driving at a high speed on slippery roads. WARNING â ABS is not designed to reduce the braking distance of the vehicle. Always keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead on: â Driving on slippery, muddy, sandy or snowy roads. â Driving on roads with multiple potholes or on uneven roads. â Driving on bumpy roads.

In such cases, reduce the vehicle speed and keep a greater distance from other vehicles. Intelligence Torque Adaption Control (iTAC) System* â The intelligent torque adaption control (iTAC) system employs a unique control architecture and algorithm that evaluates data including steering angle and motor speed and thus identifies the driver's driving needs and vehicle status. It proactively adjusts the drive torque of the front and rear axles in real time so that the driving state of the vehicle adapts to the driver's needs with better performance in complex road conditions. â When the wheels show signs of slipping, iTAC allocates the drive torque rapidly to ensure the stability of the vehicle torque, ensuring that the vehicle remains responsive and capable in diverse road conditions. â Enable or disable this function in infotainment touchscreen â   â Energy â iTAC.

If the vehicle carries heavy load frequently, front combination lights may need to be realigned. It is recommended to have the front combination lights aligned by a BYD authorized dealer or service provider. Fogging of lights â Combination lights, tail lights, and turn signals on the side mirrors may become foggy after heavy rain or cleaning. This is similar to condensation on the side window during rain. It does not mean any problem with your vehicle. â The lights are a relatively enclosed and narrow space. The temperature is very high when they light up (the mask and reflector could be burned and deformed easily), so they need heat dissipation. There are heat dissipation holes on the lamp housing for convection. The greater the temperature difference is, the more active the convection is. During the convection, the moisture in the air inevitably enters a lamp. Factors such as exposure to sunlight, convection, and bulb heating can cause the moisture in the air to condense into fog or water beads easily on the lamp surface at low temperatures. This is called fogging of lights. REMINDER â If fog presents inside the headlight and inside the turn signals on side mirrors, it may be due to high air humidity or significant temperature difference between the vehicle and its surroundings.
